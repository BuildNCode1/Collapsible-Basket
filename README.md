# Collapsible-Basket
This is a PIP Collapsible basket with an additional stand. To use it, turn the flat main basket sideways. The collapsed basket will fall down. Insert the additional stand into the slot at the bottom of the basket, and you're ready to go! To store, place the stand into the top of the basket, then turn the basket and collapse it.

Here is a picture of the complete setup (With the stand):![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11c8f28f-4676-41f1-990d-7ba38e821ae9)
